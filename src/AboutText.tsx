          Eradicating poverty, reducing inequality within and between countries
          and ensuring that no one is left behind are central to the 2030 Agenda
          for Sustainable Development and UNDP&apos;s work.
        </p>
        <p className='undp-typography'>
          Data suggests that the challenge ahead is increasingly daunting. The
          on-going polycrisis the world finds itself, not least the climate and
          debt crises, are reversing decades of progress. After thirty years of
          continuous decline, the global share of people experiencing extreme
          poverty - living on less than $2.15 a day- surged from 8.4 percent in
          2019 to 9.3 percent in 2020<sup>1</sup> as a result of COVID-19, while
          the combined effects of the pandemic, the war in Ukraine and ensuing
          cost-of-living crisis, might have pushed 75 million more people into
          extreme poverty between 2020 and the end of 2023.<sup>2</sup>
        </p>
        <p className='undp-typography'>
          If current trends continue, 575 million people will still be living in
          extreme poverty in 2030<sup>3</sup>. Furthermore, 1.1 billion people
          in 110 developing countries continue to live in multidimensional
          poverty.<sup>4</sup> Human development has fallen back to its 2016
          levels while the average global loss in human development achievements
          - health, education, and income - due to inequality is 19.4 percent
          <sup>5</sup>.
        </p>
        <p className='undp-typography'>
          Global income inequality, as measured by the global Gini Index dropped
          from about 70 in 1990 to 62 in 2019, but rose by 0.7 in 2020, as
          poorer countries were hit harder than richer countries and less able
          to provide social protection for the most vulnerable and preserve jobs
          and livelihoods<sup>6</sup>. Inequalities of opportunity continue to
          persist due to gender, age and other factors, both within and between
          countries.
        </p>
        <p className='undp-typography'>
          Climate change worsens both poverty and inequality. The income losses
          from climate hazards of the bottom 40% are estimated to be 70% larger
          than the average in low- and middle-income countries.
          <sup>7</sup>
        </p>
        <p className='undp-typography'>
          Despite increased vulnerabilities, only 28.9 percent of people in need
          - all children, along with people of working age and older people not
          covered by social insurance - receive social assistance<sup>8</sup>.
          Prior to COVID-19, 70 percent of workers in developing and low-income
          countries were informal workers. In 2022, informal employment in least
          developed countries (LDCs) stood at 89.7 percent in 2022 - against 58
          percent globally, with no improvement since 2015<sup>9</sup>. This
          underscores the urgency of inclusive and shock-responsive social
          protection systems.
        </p>
        <p className='undp-typography'>
          Poverty and inequality reduction prospects are further undermined by
          soaring debt levels. About 60% of low-income developing countries are
          in debt distress or at high risk of debt distress<sup>10</sup>. The
          average low-income country spends about 2.3 times more on interest
          payments than on social assistance
          <sup>11</sup>.

        <p className='undp-typography'>
          Gender inequality is one of the most persistent and pervasive
          challenges of our time. Stressors and shocks - including the climate
          emergency, conflicts, the economic and debt crisis, the COVID-19
          pandemic and more - aggravate the situation for women and girls all
          over the world. In some countries, women&apos;s rights are rolling
          back and a backlash against gender equality is reversing previous
          progress. This has impacts on lives and livelihoods, resilience, and
          sustainability, everywhere.
        </p>
        <p className='undp-typography'>
          The Gender Inequality Index (GII) reveals a lack of global
          improvement, with the world value stagnating at 0.465 for the past
          three years. Women&apos;s labour force participation is 46%: women
          face disparities in earnings, savings, and job security, and they are
          overrepresented in the informal sector. Women spend three times more
          hours on unpaid care work than men which, translated into labour
          market terms, would amount to 2.2 billion full-time jobs annually.
        </p>
        <p className='undp-typography'>
          Social norms help us understand imbalances and dynamics of power
          behind inequalities. Biased gender social norms are widespread
          worldwide: almost 90% of people still have at least one bias against
          women. Almost half the world&apos;s people think that men make better
          political leaders than women do - which sheds light on why only 11% of
          heads of state are women, and women hold only 22% of ministerial posts
          and 25% of parliamentary seats. More than a quarter of the
          world&apos;s population believe that it is justifiable for a man to
          beat his wife, and 26% of women over age 15 have experienced intimate
          partner violence.

          Governance systems and processes regulate how power is exercised and
          decisions are made that impact the lives and livelihoods. UNDP works
          to support accountable, effective and inclusive institutions and
          processes and ensure access to justice for all in order to accelerate
          the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

          UNDP&apos;s work on governance includes promoting inclusive and
          future-smart public goods and services, democratic institutions and
          processes, an inclusive public sphere as well as integrating
          governance principles into development polices and programmes. Working
          at global, regional and national levels, UNDP also works to promote
          the rule of law and human rights and enable more people centered
          justice and security services.

          This portal features some selected governance indicators. A
          significant challenge facing the field is the lack of data
          availability on governance related indicators. More investment is
          needed in order to produce harmonized, timely and comparable evidence
          on all dimensions of governance. UNDP works closely with national data
          producers to strengthen data availability to better monitor progress
          towards more inclusive, just and peaceful societies.

          The Arab States region comprises 20 countries with diverse economies-
          including high-income, middle-income, least-developed, and
          crisis-affected countries- and varying human development patterns with
          countries in the very high human development group, including KSA,
          UAE, Bahrain, and Qatar, and countries in the low human development
          countries - including Sudan, Djibouti, and Yemen. Despite facing
          conflicts, political and economic instability, and forced
          displacement, the region had been, before COVID-19, on a positive
          human development trajectory with a consistently increasing Human
          Development Index since 1990. Nonetheless, the pandemic compounded
          socio-economic vulnerabilities and reversed this progress, with the
          HDI dropping from 0.715 in 2019 to 0.708 in 2021, below the global HDI
          of 0.732. The unemployment rate also rose to 12.6% in the Arab States
          region, more than double the world average of 6.2%. The youth
          unemployment rate (15-24 years old), at 28.6 percent was the highest
          in the world, rising steeply from 25.3 percent in 2019.

          Furthermore, despite advancements in girls&rsquo; school enrolment and
          women&rsquo;s educational achievements in the region over the past
          three decades, the Arab States region still has the second widest
          gender gap in the world after South Asia as measured by the Gender
          Development Index (GDI), with women achieving 12.9 % less in human
          development than men in 2021. Women&rsquo;s political and economic
          participation is still very limited across the region, with, on
          average, less than one in five women in parliament and only 19.3%
          participating in the labor force, 3.6 times lower than men.

          UN Country Programme Document (CPD) and the United Nations Sustainable
          Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) for 2021-2025. They also
          align with the national Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) within
          the 2030 Agenda, and Uzbekistan&apos;s Development Strategy for
          2017-2021. Throughout 2020 UNDP helped address the national health and
          socio-economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, and is continuing to
          actively assist in Uzbekistan&apos;s inclusive, green recovery.

        Located in South-Eastern Europe, with aspirations of joining the EU,
        Montenegro recognizes the significance of its accession journey for both
        its progress and SDGs achievement. With a population of 620,000 and an
        impressive Human Development Index of 0.832, driven by investments and
        tourism, its robust economic growth reduced the poverty rate to 14.5% by
        2019. Nonetheless, recent challenges like COVID-19 and global price
        hikes exposed economic vulnerabilities, leading to increased poverty
        rates. The pandemic has undone six years of strides in human
        development, disproportionately affecting vulnerable groups reliant on
        the informal sector. Evident in amplified hate speech and gender-based
        violence, social exclusion has intensified. Remarkably,
        Montenegro&apos;s Gender Equality Index stands at 55 (2019), juxtaposed
        with the EU&apos;s average of 67.4. Youth potential remains untapped due
        to underemployment and limited civic engagement. Marginalized
        communities such as the Roma, Egyptian minorities, people with
        disabilities, and the elderly face education gaps and exclusion from
        crucial services. Despite economic growth in 2021, Montenegro&apos;s
        government focuses on boosting competitiveness, regional connectivity,
        and nurturing a sustainable green economy, all aimed at fostering smart,
        sustainable, and comprehensive progress. The nation commits to bettering
        the environment, building resilience, and slashing greenhouse gas
        emissions by 35% before 2030. With a notable acceptance of Ukrainian
        refugees relative to its size, Montenegro eyes migration to unlock human
        capital for future development. These combined efforts, along with
        economic transformation, aim to bolster resilience, nurture human
        development, and rectify societal disparities.

          Situated in the heart of the Balkans, Serbia is a lend-lock country,
          undergoing significant transformation. With a strategic geographical
          position connecting Central and Southeast Europe, Serbia has actively
          pursued EU integration, reflecting its commitment to fostering
          regional stability and economic growth. As of now, Serbia holds the
          status of a candidate country, with ongoing negotiations that
          underline its aspirations for EU membership.
        </p>
        <p className='undp-typography'>
          In terms of politics, Serbia operates under a parliamentary system,
          and its recent history has been marked by democratic transitions after
          political changes in October 2000. The Serbian economy is primarily
          driven by market forces, with a sizeable presence of the state sector
          in certain sectors, such as energy. The country&apos;s proximity to
          the European Union and its cost-competitive and skilled labor force
          are its primary advantages. Among the contributors to the positive
          trend were a decrease in public sector expenditure, the flexibility of
          the labor market, and enhanced business regulations.
        </p>
        <p className='undp-typography'>
          However, Serbia faces challenges, such as environmental concerns and
          depopulation trends in certain regions. Environmental issues are being
          addressed through initiatives to enhance sustainability and
          conservation efforts. Serbia seeks to maximize the potential of a
          green, inclusive, and sustainable economy, but pollution remains a
          challenge. Furthermore, depopulation in rural areas underscores the
          need for comprehensive policies to stimulate regional growth and
          balance urban-rural dynamics. The population is projected to decrease
          from 6.9 million to 5.8 million by 2050, which, at 23.8%, is the
          steepest decline in the Western Balkans. Low immigration to Serbia and
          a total fertility rate below the replacement level of 2.1 children per
          woman are altering the age structure of the population. In the
          twenty-first century, Serbia will have a smaller, elderly, and more
          female population.

          Turkmenistan is an upper middle-income country which has experienced a
          robust economic growth in recent decade due to increased prices of
          hydrocarbons at global markets. The revenues from the export of the
          energy resources allowed the Government to invest into development of
          the non-hydrocarbon economy and build strategic infrastructure that
          would benefit country&apos;s social and economic growth and strengthen
          their positions regionally.

          Turkmenistan became independent in 1991 and joined the United Nations
          on 2 March 1992 as a new independent state. On December 12, 1995,
          Turkmenistan was recognized as a permanently neutral State by the
          resolution of the UN General Assembly with the unanimous support of
          185 member States. At present Turkmenistan has established diplomatic
          relations with 151 countries.

          In 2022 the Government announced the new National Socioeconomic
          Development Program of Turkmenistan for the period 2022-2052 as a
          start-up of a new phase of large-scale changes focusing on market
          reforms, economic diversification, investment in human capital and
          achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.

          Turkmenistan pays special attention to the cooperation with
          international organizations and the UN system in particular. The
          country regularly comes forward with the initiatives in the areas of
          security, energy, transport, climate and water, promoting regional
          cooperation, and encouraging global commitment to promote sustainable
          development. The Government actively cooperates with UNDP in key
          strategic areas and continuously acknowledges its contribution to the
          promotion of the national development agenda.
